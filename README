To use this screensaver, you must have version 2.6.13 of the Cinnamon desktop installed (or at least a version with cinnamon-screensaver which supports Webkit).  Just place this directory in the directory with all of the other Webkit screensavers (this is usually /usr/share/cinnamon-screensaver/screensavers/webkit@cinnamon.org/).
