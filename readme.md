Dancing Kirby Screensaver
=====

This is a cute little screensaver which plays a random song from a list that you set.

To use this screensaver, you must have at least version 2.6.13 of the Cinnamon desktop installed (or at least a version with
cinnamon-screensaver which supports Webkit).  Just place this directory in the directory with all of the other Webkit screensavers
(this is usually `/usr/share/cinnamon-screensaver/screensavers/webkit@cinnamon.org/`).  You may have to give the directory a name
like `webkit-kirby_dancing@cinnamon.org` for the screensaver settings dialog to pick it up.  Also, since I can't host this picture
due to copyright reasons, you can find a copy of it [here](http://imgur.com/a/5wp9X).

In the file, `index.html`, locate the array called `mr_array` and put in the path to your file as an element in the array.  The
code should do the rest.
